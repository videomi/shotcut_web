            <p>Shotcut was originally conceived in
            <a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.fltk.general/2397">November, 2004</a>
            by Charlie Yates, an MLT co-founder and the original lead developer
            (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050401015503/http://users.pandora.be/acp/shotcut/">see the original
                website</a>). The current version of Shotcut is a complete rewrite by Dan Dennedy, another MLT
                co-founder and its current lead. Dan wanted to create a new editor based on MLT and he chose to reuse
                the Shotcut name since he liked it so much. He wanted to make something to exercise the new
                cross-platform capabilities of MLT especially in conjunction with the
                <a href="https://github.com/mltframework/webvfx#readme">WebVfx</a> and
                <a href="https://movit.sesse.net/">Movit</a> plugins.</p>
