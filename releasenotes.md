  but different exension.

- Fixed opening files with a `%` in their path or name.
- Added snapping to the playhead to **Keyframes**.
- Added **Help > Actions and Shortcuts**:
  - Provides a unified action search and shortcut editor.
  - Replaces the old **Keyboard Shortcuts...** item in the **Help** menu and takes its keyboard shortcut <kbd>?</kbd>.

  - Press <kbd>Esc</kbd> when the dialog has focus to close it.
  - Press <kbd>F2</kbd> when an action is selected to edit its first shortcut.
  - Single-click a selected shortcut to enter edit mouse using the mouse. This means you typically need two single
    clicks: one to select, the second to enter into edit mode.
  - You can <kbd>Tab</kbd> out of edit mode to navigate focus to the apply button and press <kbd>Space</kbd> to
    trigger the apply. It is intentional that you cannot assign <kbd>Tab</kbd> as a keyboard shortcut to an action.
  - There are some keyboard buttons such as J/K/L that are reserved and cannot be used in a shortcut.
    You will see an error message when you try to apply it.
  - You can define up to 2 shortcuts per action! You may want to leave the default as well as add your preferred shortcut.
  - A big portion of the UI had to be rewritten to support this. As a result:

    - Panel-specific Options sub-menus were moved to **Settings** main menu.
    - The keyboard shortcut to switch the player between **Source** and **Project** is now <kbd>P</kbd>.
    - Various hidden or under-exposed actions now have a menu item somewhere including a new **Player** main menu.
    - Many translations will be lost.
    - The default shortcuts to change the current track now require <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd> in addition to
      cursor up and down.
- Improved support for custom video transitions:
  - There is a folder now in the App Data Directory named `transitions` where you can store these.
  - All files in the `transitions` folder are listed in transition **Properties**, the **Mask: From File** video filter,
    and the **Slideshow Generator** dialog.
  - Added a favorite button in transition **Properties** and **Mask: From File** that copies your chosen custom file to
    the `transitions` folder.
  - Added a quick preview to transition properties.
- Added the ability to drag-scroll/pan using the middle mouse button (press mouse wheel) to **Timeline**,
  **Keyframes**, and the player when zoomed in.
- Improved the **Filters** picker:
  - Added translatable keywords to facilitate search. For example, "transform" includes **Size, Position & Rotate**.
  - Added the English filter name in an untranslatable manner to the keywords so people using a translation can more
    more easily find things based on proliferic English advice.
  - Added support for a small animated icon.

    filters are in a project

    Then, use this path to default save dialogs such as next XML or
    video stabilization data.
-   On OS X, when using System theme, stack the display volume and mute
    toggles so these widgets do not appear so wide.
-   Workaround for the Stabilize filter's analysis job crashing on
    Windows.<br>The analysis job still crashes at the end, but
    the data is still created and usable. So, go ahead and try to use
    the data regardless of the job's failure.
-   Make adjusting image duration on timeline easier.<br>Now,
    the Duration field in Properties adjusts the out point, and the
    actual duration is 10 minutes. This lets you add just a few seconds
    to the Timeline by default but then stretch or shrink the image clip
    on the timeline up to 10 minutes. If you need more than 10 minutes,
    add the clip to the track again.
