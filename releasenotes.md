    Then, use this path to default save dialogs such as next XML or
    video stabilization data.
-   On OS X, when using System theme, stack the display volume and mute
    toggles so these widgets do not appear so wide.
-   Workaround for the Stabilize filter's analysis job crashing on
    Windows.<br>The analysis job still crashes at the end, but
    the data is still created and usable. So, go ahead and try to use
    the data regardless of the job's failure.
-   Make adjusting image duration on timeline easier.<br>Now,
    the Duration field in Properties adjusts the out point, and the
    actual duration is 10 minutes. This lets you add just a few seconds
    to the Timeline by default but then stretch or shrink the image clip
    on the timeline up to 10 minutes. If you need more than 10 minutes,
    add the clip to the track again.
