### Location

If an `appdatadir` folder is supplied (see below), the configuration file is
named shotcut.ini in the folder. Otherwise, where the configuration lives
depends on the operating system:

**Windows**

The settings are
stored in the registry at key
HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\\Software\\Meltytech\\Shotcut\\.

**Linux**

The settings are stored in \~/.config/Meltytech/Shotcut.conf, which is a
text file in INI format.

**macOS**

The settings are stored in
\~/Library/Preferences/com.meltytech.Shotcut.plist, which is a [binary
plist](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man5/plist.5.html)
file.

### Keys

How the category appears depends on the config file format. Linux conf and Windows INI file uses sections (square brackets), Windows registry uses a sub-key (except General), and macOS plist
prefixes the key name followed by a period and the key (except General). In 
Windows registry, a bool is stored as a string: true or false.
