title: How To Use the Linux SDK

## DISCONTINUED

The Linux SDK has been discontinued for now since QtWebKit is removed making it much easier to use Qt from your Linux
distribution or the Qt installer/MaintenanceTool. You need the latest release version of MLT, but for some new features
or to be more like a release build of Shotcut you need the git master branch version of MLT. There are some optional
dependencies of MLT simply to build and for basic usage. If you want to run versions that are most consistent with
release or nightly builds of Shotcut, you can use the build script (same as what GitHub Actions build agent runs) at
`scripts/build-shotcut.sh`.

## Legacy

1. Download and install the following:
  - Qt Creator from the [Qt project](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/) or your distribution packages.
  - [Our special build of the Qt 5.9.7 SDK that includes QtWebKit](https://s3.amazonaws.com/misc.meltymedia/shotcut-build/qt-5.9.7-ubuntu16.04-x86_64.txz)    
    Extract it to $HOME/Qt
  - [Shotcut SDK (733 MiB! current version 20.09.27)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/builds.us.meltytech/shotcut/shotcut-linux-x86_64-sdk-200927.txz)    
    Extract it to $HOME/Projects

2. Start Qt Creator and choose **Tools &gt; Options &gt; Build &amp; Run**  
Configure all of your settings in the Build & Run section.
  - Manually set the Qt version.
  ![Version Settings](versions_build_run.png)
  - Configure the project kit from the previously set Qt version.

3. Extract the Shotcut SDK .bz2 file to a new folder in $HOME called "Projects".
4. In Qt Creator open shotcut.pro from $HOME/Projects/Shotcut/Shotcut.app/src/shotcut.
5. In the Shotcut project configuration screen find **Build Settings**.  
   - Under **Build steps &gt; qmake &gt; Additional arguments** add  
   `MLT_PATH=../../.. PREFIX=../../..`
   - Under **Build Steps &gt; Make &gt; Make arguments** add "-j" for faster parallel compilation.
6. In the Shotcut project configuration screen find **Run Settings**.  
   - Under **Deployment** click **Add Deploy Step &gt; Make**, and in **Make arguments** add "install".  
   - Under **Run &gt; Run configuration** click **Add &gt; Custom Executable &gt; Executable** add   `$HOME/Projects/Shotcut/Shotcut.app/bin/shotcut`
   - Under **Run Environment &gt; Details** add the following environment variables:
     - Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to `${HOME}/Projects/Shotcut/Shotcut.app/lib:${QTDIR}/lib:${HOME}/Projects/Shotcut/Shotcut.app/src/build-shotcut-Desktop_Qt_5_9_7_GCC_64bit-Debug/CuteLogger`
     - Set `MLT_DATA` to `${HOME}/Projects/Shotcut/Shotcut.app/share/mlt`
     - Set `MLT_PRESETS_PATH` to `${HOME}/Projects/Shotcut/Shotcut.app/share/mlt/presets`
     - Set `MLT_PROFILES_PATH` to `${HOME}/Projects/Shotcut/Shotcut.app/share/mlt/profiles`
     - Set `MLT_REPOSITORY` to `${HOME}/Projects/Shotcut/Shotcut.app/lib/mlt`
     - Set `QML2_IMPORT_PATH` to `${QTDIR}/qml`
     - Set `QT_PLUGIN_PATH` to `${QTDIR}/plugins`

7. Go back to **Edit** mode, right-click "shotcut" in the project tree, and choose **Rebuild**.

8. After clicking **Run**, you can confirm the newly built executable is the one
   that is running from the **About** dialog: the version will be today's date.
