Version 20.02.17 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

## New

### Low Resolution Preview Scaling

Most people's video preview area only occupies a fraction of their screen.

<a data-rel="prettyPhoto" href="{{ "/assets/img/screenshots/Screenshot_20200214_171626.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">
<img src="{{ "/assets/img/screenshots/Screenshot_20200214_171626.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}"
alt="Screenshot of preview" width="3192" height="1373"></a>

Meanwhile, the app is struggling to process effects in realtime while editing a
1080p or higher video. So, it makes sense to change the processing resolution
while editing to roughly the same as the preview window. For example, for many
people, the video preview typically only occupies 1/9 of their 1080p screen.
Thus, you can edit at 640x360 instead of 1920x1080 to give the app and computer less
work.

This is now available in the **Settings** under **Preview Scaling**. If you
are using a larger or high DPI screen or editing higher resolution, you might
want to edit at a higher resolution, and Shotcut also offers options for 540p
and 720p in addition to 360p for the preview vertical resolution.

Please remember that today there is still a processing cost to scale down the
source video to the preview resolution. So, this is still not a silver-bullet,
magical cure-all for performance issues. This feature will be more beneficial
when low resolution proxies are used, which is planned for version 20.04 in April.

Also, please understand that preview scaling is a step further away from WYSIWYG
and does not provide perfect fidelity and full precision. Some differences are
unavoidable especially where blur, softness, and noise are concerned.

In addition, some filters do not support preview scaling and will process at
full project resolution:
  * Choppy
  * Rutt-Etra-Izer
  * Stabilize
  * Text: HTML > Blank with Web Animations
  * Text: HTML > Simple Scroll
  * Text: HTML > Two Column Scroll

Lastly, a **Use preview scaling** checkbox has been added to **Export > Advanced >
Video**. This is intended to provide a faster export for draft review. You
should leave the export resolution set to the project resolution unless your
preset or video codec dictates a resolution.

### Audio Pitch Filter

Ever since we made it possible to change the speed of a clip, people have wanted
a way to keep the audio at roughly the same pitch instead of going lower or higher.
Also, sometimes people want to use a pitch effect for comical reasons or to
disguise a voice. We are happy to announce a new **Pitch** audio filter.
This has a speed compensation parameter so that you can copy the speed value
from **Properties** into the filter. In the next version, we will directly
integrate a pitch compensation option in the **Properties** panel. Please
consider that this really only works with decent quality in the 4.0x - 0.25x
speed range.

### More Transitions

Frequently, people ask for more transitions. Well, how about 150+!?
After you create a transition by overlapping clips on the same track, select
the transition and look in **Properties > Video**. There has always been a
**Custom...** option where you can upload a gray scale still image, and our
[Resources page]({{ "/resources/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})
provides a list of resources where to get them. In this version you can now
use a grayscale video clip, which some call a "matte transition."
[Forum](https://forum.shotcut.org/) user @jonray has put together a [nice
collection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vl9jHXgwDOD7o4m1_17rYYCw5aCBZTxv)
of these, also on the Resource page.

<video width="320" height="180" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop">
  <source src="{{ "/assets/videos/screencast-matte-transition.mp4" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Please be aware that these transitions do
not automatically adjust their duration. If you do not make the transition long
enough, it will likely be abrupt at the end. If you make it longer, however,
there is no problem. You can also use these to make multi-track transitions by
adding the **Mask: From File** video filter to the clip on a higher video track.

### Other Enhancements

- Added **Views > Scopes > Video Vector**.  
  Note that the graticule on this is [non-traditional, inspired by Alexis Van 
  Hurkman](http://vanhurkman.com/wordpress/?p=2563).
- Added the ability to rename clips in **Properties** by clicking into the
  header where the name is displayed.
- Added a few more export presets:
  * audio/ALAC
  * audio/FLAC
  * intermediate/DNxHR HQ
  * intermediate/ProRes HQ
  * intermediate/ProRes was changed to ProRes 422
- Added **Arabic** translation.

## Fixes

- Fixed dropping multiple files to **Playlist** in a new project (broken in v19.12.31).
- Fixed some broken keyboard shortcuts in the Turkish translation.
- Fixed **Properties > Speed** not working after a project file repair.
- Fixed clip selection after **Insert Track** or **Remove Track**.
- Fixed **Playlist > Add Selected to Timeline** creates corrupt clips (broken in v19.12.31).
- Fixed **Settings > Display Method > Software (Mesa)** on Windows (broken in v19.12.31).
- Fixed creating a **Project folder** with leading or trailing spaces.
- Fixed saving the `length` property in MLT XML as a time value independent of
  frame rate.
- Fixed starting **Text: Simple** video filter with "@" shows "0".
- Fixed seeking previous &amp; next on the first track in **Keyframes** where
  you trim a filter or use simple keyframes.
- Fixed an unexpected transition is created when moving a clip rightward
  adjacent to the next clip in **Timeline** (regression in v19.12.16).
- Fixed drag-n-drop from **Source** player to **Timeline** left player in an
  inconsistent state (broken in v19.09.14).
- Fixed an inconsistent colorspace conversion when accessing a cached image.
- Fixed **Playlist > Copy** followed by a change in **Properties** incorrectly
  changes the playlist item.
- Fixed clicking on the rectangle control may change its size.
- Fixed using the **LUT (3D)** filter with file with extended characters in its
  file path on Windows.
- Fixed a crash when using a transition on every track at the same time.

## Changes

- Improved the reliability of **Timeline > Select None**.
- Changed **Timeline > Master > Properties > Frame rate** to show 6 decimal digits.
- Reduced the latency of scrubbing (regression in v19.12.31).
- Changed the video-overlay rectangle control used in some filters to allow
  changing the position by dragging from anywhere inside the rectangle.  
To enable this, one must first double-click the center circle to change the mode.
Otherwise, you would be prevented from dragging the clip out of the Source player.
- Changed the **Filters** panel on macOS to prevent floating to avoid a
  frequently reported problem of the **Filters** window appearing blank/black.
- Changed **Timeline > clip context menu > Detach Audio** to not seek afterwards.
- Improved mouse wheel and trackpad behavior in **Timeline**.  
Now, you do not need to ensure the mouse pointer is over a clip, speed is
reduced, and zoom keeps focal point in view. The new zoom behavior does not
apply when using the option **Center the Playhead** in the timeline menu.
- Upgraded MLT to version 6.20.0 and WebVfx to version 1.2.0.
