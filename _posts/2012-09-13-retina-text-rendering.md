As of version 12.09.13, the OS X build of Shotcut supports high resolution text rendering in the user interface on the new MacBook Pro with retina display. Unfortunately, it does not yet support double resolution icons, which is not too noticeable, but also extending the support to the embedded video is also still a challenge with Qt and OpenGL. We will revisit that later.
