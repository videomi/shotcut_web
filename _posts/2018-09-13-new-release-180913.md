Version 18.09 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

**UPDATE:** Version 18.09 has been
[re-released (build 18.09.16)]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})
to fix major new bugs with the **Rotate and Scale**, **Size and
Position**, **Text**, **Chroma Key**, **Key Spill**, and **White Balance** filters.

This release is packed with fixes and improvements in many areas!

### More

##### Timeline
- Added **Ripple** support for **moving** clips including **Ripple All Tracks**.
- When **Ripple** is on and you move a clip to the right, it now
ripples (pushes) all the clips to the right instead of making a transition
(including the **Ripple All Tracks** option).

</video>

&nbsp;
- Added **Ctrl+R** keyboard shortcut to toggle **Timeline Ripple**,  
**Ctrl+Alt+R** to toggle **Ripple All Tracks**, and  
**Ctrl+Shift+R** to toggle both.
- Improved **Snapping** behavior on the **Timeline**.
- Added **Ctrl+P** keyboard shortcut to toggle **Snapping**.
- Added **Reset Track Height** (**Ctrl+0**) to the **Timeline** menu.

##### Filters
- Added a **Timer** video filter.  
- Added support for negative rotation to the **Rotate and Scale** filter.  
- Added **Shake 1 Second - Scaled** and **Shake 1 Second - Unscaled** presets
to the **Size and Position** filter.

&nbsp;

##### Other
- Added a **Text** clip to the **Open Other** dialog.  
This is a convenience item that creates a transparent **Color** clip with a
**Text** filter.
- Added **Extract Sub-clip** to **Properties** menu for audio/video clip.
- Added **Export** presets for WebM VP8 and VP9 with alpha channel.

### Better

##### Stability Fixes

- Fixed a crash when quickly changing clip selections in the **Timeline**.
- Improved closing Shotcut more reliably and the behavior of multiple shotcut
processes.
- Fixed **Undo** beyond **Remove Track** may crash.
- Fixed a crash when moving a clip after undoing a transition.
- Fixed a crash loading project after some sequence of inserting and removing tracks.
- Fixed a crash loading an image with the wrong filename extension.
- Fixed OS audio device changes may cause Shotcut to hang.
- Fixed crash dragging simple keyframes beyond the edges of the clip.
- The 32-bit Windows build can use more memory to reduce risk of crash:  
3 GiB on 32-bit Windows and 4 GiB on 64-bit Windows.
- Fixed a crash applying an image transform filter to an image with alpha
channel (PNG, SVG).

##### Bug Fixes

- Improved behavior of opening WebP images.
- Fixed advanced keyframes for the **Size and Position** filter.
- Fixed inserted and then hidden video tracks become audio tracks after
re-opening the project.
- Fixed changing **Video Mode** from **Automatic** to something else with
nothing opened.
- Fixed moving a transition to another track leaves a hidden clip on the old track.
- Fixed trimming the out point of a timeline clip may change the in point of
the following clip.
- Fixed **Properties** > **Speed**, **Convert**, **Reverse**, and
**More Information** does not work sometimes after reloading a project.
- Fixed reliability of changing size and position fields with keyframes
in **Size and Position** and **Text** filters.
- Fixed trimming outward with **Ripple All Tracks** moved clips on other tracks
in the wrong direction.
- Fixed audio waveforms still appear on muted tracks after adding a track.
- Fixed dragging clips to the **Timeline** stops working.

##### Image Fidelity

- Fixed edges of text with the **Text** filter may get cut off (clipped).
- Fixed **Size and Position** and **Rotate and Scale** filters may leave black
right and bottom edge of frame.
- Fixed trimming a timeline clip with **Fade In/Out Video** filters
with "Adjust opacity instead of fade with black" enabled.
- Fixed **Export** may change the actual frame rate and cause timing errors.
- Fixed reducing the **Frame/sec** in **Export** causes timing errors in the output.
- Fixed image scaling interpolation method when not using a transform filter.

##### Changes
 
- Removed the **Compositing** toggle icon from the **Timeline** track head. Now,
it is located in the track **Properties** as **Blend mode** with a **None** option.
- In the **3D Text** filter, replaced the Droid fonts with Liberation due to an
incompatible license.

### Faster

Well, to be honest, there is not much speed improvement. Most of the improvement
comes from a fix to prevent an incomplete shutdown. In the case of the 32-bit
Windows build, since more memory can be accessed now, we have removed some of
(not all) multi-threading limits.

- Improved the performance of changing filter parameters and scrubbing.
- Limit the number of background thumbnail and waveform generation threads to 4.
- Prevent trying to generate audio levels for waveforms for still images and
other silent sources.
