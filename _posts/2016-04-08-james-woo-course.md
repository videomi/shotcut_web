title: New Video Tutorial Course by James Woo
author: Dan Dennedy
category: blog

Shotcut power user, James Woo, has created a wonderful
[course on how to use Shotcut](https://betterbusiness.zenler.com/courses/video-editing-made-easy-with-shotcut-video-editor&affiliate=1367).

Currently, it contains 24 videos and costs $25, but it only costs $20 using the
coupon code in the link on this blog post! As the
lead developer of Shotcut, I reviewed the entire course, and I think it is very
good. James clearly and accurately explains many thing from basics to more
advanced techniques such as picture-in-picture, chroma keying, and using custom
HTML. The lessons are sequenced in a nice progressive manner, but you can also
directly visit specific topics. These are presented in the English language.
