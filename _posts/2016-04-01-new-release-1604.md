#### Audio Loudness

The previous audio normalize filter has been renamed to **Normalize: Two Pass**.
Its functionality has not changed. This type of normalization is most
appropriate for previously mixed clips like music.

The new **Normalize: One Pass** filter analyzes the audio in real time as the clip
is played and adjusts the gain on the clip in real time in order to achieve the target loudness.
Unlike the two pass filter, the one pass filter can be applied to an entire track
as well as a clip. This filter is most useful for clips where the audio has not
been mixed, or its volume changes varies a lot. Also, because the filter is being
applied dynamically, and it is reacting to historical loudness, it may not
actually achieve the target loudness with high accuracy.
Therefore, the two pass filter is still better applied to a number of consistent
or pre-mixed clips to bring them all to the same level.

To complement the normalization filters, a new **Audio Loudness**
scope has been added to the **View > Scopes** menu. It shows the Momentary,
Short-term, and Integrated loudness as well as the Loudness Range.

#### New Video Filters

While it has been possible to use the **Color Grading** filter to adjust video
levels, it has a limitation to lowering the black level, and it is not really
obvious to most users how to increase contrast. So, we added **Brightness** and
**Contrast** filters that work both with GPU or CPU processing.

The new **Reduce Noise** filter can be useful for reducing noise or film grain in a source clip.
[MLT](https://www.mltframework.org/) -- the engine of Shotcut -- actually now
supports [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) filters!
And this is the first Shotcut fitler to use that capability. This filter is
actually the FFmpeg libavfilter [smartblur](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#smartblur-1).

#### More FFmpeg Goodness

The **Properties** panel for a clip has a menu button
<img src="{{ "/assets/img/screenshots/format-justify-fill.png" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}" width="16" height="16">
(sometimes called a hamburger menu).
This is an overflow menu that contains
advanced or seldomly used actions without cluttering the user interface.
A new menu item **More Information** runs the FFmpeg ffprobe utility against the
clip to show many more attributes available.

Another menu item **Start Integrity Check Job** adds a job to the **Jobs** view
that runs the ffmpeg utility to read and decode everything in the file and report
any errors. This is handy to see if a problem you are having may be linked to a
corrupt file.

Moreover, every install of Shotcut has always included the ffmpeg command line
utility but now it also includes the ffplay and ffprobe binary executables!
If you need a modern version of these utilities but have not always found it
convenient to locate or install them, now they are here. Sure, they may not be
linked against a large number of libraries, but the popular codecs are included.
Sorry, but these are NOT static (standalone) executables -- you need to leave them
where they are so they can find their libraries. Here is where they are:

- Linux: ~/Shotcut/Shotcut.app
- OS X: /Applications/Shotcut.app/Contents/MacOS
- Windows: C:\Program Files\Shotcut

#### Stability

We're always trying to improve in these areas. A few crash bugs have been squashed
such as when trimming on the timeline. Some Windows users have also been reporting
a crash-upon-launch when Shotcut used to previously start with no problem.
We still do not know the cause, but we learned that
something in the registry settings
is triggering the problem. Most people with this problem reported having attempted
to reinstall Shotcut. Therefore, we added an option to remove the Shotcut registry
settings to the installer. We hope that will help people rescue their installation.

A number of people have reported that the exported video is all or mostly black
silence. This has not affected any of the developers making it go undetected
and unresolved for a long time, but we finally determined the cause and fixed that.


#### Usability

Many users have asked questions about why filters are
disappearing or hiding somewhere! We learned that users were not always clear
about what is selected and what **Filters** is affecting. It did not help
that sometimes the timeline-as-a-whole was frequently "auto-selected."
Did you know that filters can not only be attached to clips but also a track
or the entire timeline?
Therefore, the timline is no longer auto-selected, and a red outline now appears
around the selection. Also, the headings of the **Filters** and **Properties**
panels are now more visually prominent and identify what is selected & affected:
