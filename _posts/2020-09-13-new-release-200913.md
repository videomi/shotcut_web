Version 20.09.13 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

## Security Notice

All users are encouraged to upgrade to address a security vulnerability
([CVE-2020-24619](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-24619)) in Shotcut's check for a new version.
In previous versions it was not using a secure network connection making it is possible for an attacker to change the
URL to the web page containing the release notes and download link. That has been fixed in this version.

## HTML5 Deprecation

Shotcut's HTML5-based filters -- including non-obvious video filters such as **Crop: Rectangle** in previous versions --
were based on an old technology (QtWebKit) that we decided to remove. The technology is no longer officially supported
by its founding organization and hinders our ability to upgrade more important technology. Moreover, there were some
lingering stability bugs related to its integration that are very difficult to fix. In the previous version, some
filters were marked as "DEPRECATED" as a result of this decision, namely **Text: HTML**, but not **Crop: Rectangle**,
**Crop: Circle**, and **Choppy**. These were rewritten for this version. This new version automatically converts the
**Choppy**, **Crop: Circle**, and **Crop: Rectangle** video filters in an existing project to their new replacements.
Also, we added a new video filter named **Text: Rich**. It is not as capable as the old **Text: HTML**, but it should be
easier to use and manage while being more reliable. The deprecated HTML-based filters are still included in this
version, but now they are hidden. They will appear only when loading old projects that include them. This provides a
transition to the next version that actually removes these filters: You can load an old project using the deprecated
filters and replace or remove them.

## New

### Blur: Pad Video Filter

This is a new useful alternative to cropping to remove black bars from images or videos whose aspect ratio does not
match the project. It is available in the slideshow generator as **Pad Blur**.

### Text: Rich Video Filter

The rich text editor writes directly on the video preview, has a floating toolbar, and saves itself into the project
file with no external HTML files to manage.

### New Stock Layouts with Quick Switcher

- Replaced **View > Layout > Timeline Project** with new, better **Logging**, **Editing**, **FX**, **Color**, **Audio**, and **Player** stock (pre-defined) layouts.
- The current layout is saved automatically for each stock layout if selected, and **Restore Default Layout** is different for each stock layout.
- Added a workspace layout switcher to the main toolbar for the new stock workspace layouts.
  Shotcut has had a named layout system and switching in the View menu for a while now, but the stock layouts were
  lacking imagination. Taking inspiration from some other tools, we add new ones

<div class="centered">
    <div id="carousel-example-generic" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
        <!-- Indicators -->
        <ol class="carousel-indicators">
            {% for img in page.carousel %}
                <li data-target="#carousel-example-generic" data-slide-to="{{ forloop.index0 }}" 
                {% if forloop.index0 == 0 %}
                    class="active"
                {% endif %}>
                </li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ol>

        <!-- Wrapper for slides -->
        <div class="carousel-inner">
            {% for img in page.carousel.first %}
                <div class="item active">
                    <img src="{{ "/assets/img/project/carousel/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}{{ img }}" width="1560" height="860" alt="">
                </div>
            {% endfor %}
            {% for img in page.carousel offset:1 %}
                <div class="item">
                    <img src="{{ "/assets/img/project/carousel/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}{{ img }}" width="1560" height="860" alt="">
                </div>
            {% endfor %}
        </div>
    </div> <!--/Carousel -->
</div><br>

### Other New Things

- Added **Zoom to fit** icons to the **Timeline** and **Keyframes** toolbars. Thanks to @Namna for this contribution.
- Added a VUI to the **360: Transform** video filter to adjust parameters by dragging inside the player.
- Added **Set Equirectangular Projection...** to the **Jobs** menu for a successful export job. This is used to add metadata to a video file to indicate it is 360à¥° video in the equirectangular projection as required by most players and web services. We thank
  [Varol Okan](https://github.com/VarolOkan/) for the code we used to add this.

## Changes

- Improved the performance of the **Timeline** especially with projects over one hour long.
- Changed **Size and Position** to **Size, Position & Rotate** and made **Rotate and Scale** hidden (only appears in old projects).
- Replaced **Choppy**, **Crop: Circle**, and **Crop: Rectangle** filters with new versions that do not use HTML through WebVfx, which was deprecated in version 20.06.28.
- Changed the **Rutt-Etra-Izer**, **Swirl**, and **Text: 3D** filters to be hidden since they are deprecated  (still loads in old projects).
- Changed the video track hidden icon on the System theme to be more clear and obvious.
- Show an error dialog on startup if the frei0r plugins are not installed (only affects Linux distribution packages).
- Changed the keyboard shortcut <kbd>0</kbd> to zoom timeline to fit.
- Changed the keyboard shortcut <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd> to zoom playlist to fit.
- Changed the **Timeline** and **Keyframes** time ruler interval to 1 second when zoomed in.
- Upgraded FFmpeg to version 4.3.1.
