Version 21.01.29 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

#### New

- Added support for [AV1](https://research.mozilla.org/av1-media-codecs/) decoding and encoding.  
  A lot of people are unexepectedly downloading AV1 from YouTube, and this makes Shotcut comptible with those files.  
  (*Please be aware that AV1 encoding is naturally very slow and that is not a bug.*)

- Added an **Advanced** mode to the **Properties > Convert to Edit-friendly** dialog with:
  - Added detection of a HDR transfer function (ITU-R BT.2020 or SMPTE ST2084) to automatically show **Convert** dialog.
  - Added **Convert to BT.709 colorspace** that provides **HDR-to-SDR [tone mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_mapping)**!  
    This helps a lot of people who are recording games in HDR and were surpised by the poor colors when editing in Shotcut.
  - Added **Deinterlace** option (bwdif) that outputs one frame for each field.
  - Added **Override frame rate** and **Frame rate conversion** with **Blend** and **Motion Compensation** options.  
    (*Please be aware that **Motion Compensation** is very slow and that is not a bug.*)
- Added **Use Higher Performance Waveforms** to **Timeline** and **Keyframes** menus (default on).
- Added a red outline around the thumnbail of the currently opened **Playlist** item.
- Added video filter **Reduce Noise: Quantization**.
