Version 15.09 is ready for <a href="{{  "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">download</a> and aims to improve compatibility and stability on <b>modern</b> systems. This was primarily achieved by upgrading to <a href="http://www.qt.io/qt5-5/">Qt 5.5</a>. This fixes compatibility issues on Linux systems with AMD graphics. It also introduces a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX">DirectX</a> display method option on Windows (when not using GPU processing) for systems with inadequate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL">OpenGL</a>. With that said, there are some caveats; notice we said "modern systems." The new version is 64-bit only for all operating systems. After all, 64-bit CPUs have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_K8">available for nearly 12 years</a>. Also, the OS X version requires at least OS X 10.8. In addition:
<ul><li>Added <b>Scrub Audio</b> to Settings menu.</li><li>Added <b>Display Method</b> to Settings menu (Windows only).</li><li>Added <b>Portugal Portuguese</b> translation to Settings menu.</li><li>Added <b>Mute</b> audio filter.</li><li>Updated <a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> to v2.7.</li></ul>
