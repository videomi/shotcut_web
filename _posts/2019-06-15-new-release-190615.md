Version 19.06 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

## Changes and Improvements

### Project Files

This version makes a big change to the way project files are saved. Now, they
always save numeric values using a period for the decimal point regardless of
your OS locale (region/language) setting. This makes it possible to collaborate
with others that have a different decimal point setting without going through a
(probably incomplete) repair process. This should also help to avoid bugs. This
change applies to new projects only; old projects load and run same as before
including saving. However, be aware that if your locale does not use a period
for the decimal point, then older versions of Shotcut will try to repair a
project created with this version because the older versions do not have this
new capability.

### Timeline and Keyframes Rulers

We changed the **Timeline** and **Keyframes** rulers interval to 5 seconds and
show only HH:MM:SS and no frame units. This makes them cleaner and quicker to
read.

### Reorganized Some Video Filters

- Renamed video filter **Circular Frame** to **Crop: Circle**.
- Renamed video filter **Crop** to **Crop: Source**.
- Renamed video filter **Text** to **Text: Simple**.
- Renamed video filter **3D Text** to **Text: 3D**.
- Renamed video filter **Overlay HTML** to **Text: HTML**.
- Renamed video filter **Blur** to **Blur: Box**.
- Renamed **Reduce Noise** video filter to **Reduce Noise: Smart Blur**.

### Other Changes

- Changed **Export > From** to show **Source** instead of base file name.
- Changed the default for **Settings > Display Method** back to **DirectX** on
Windows.
- Changed maximum duration of **Color**, **Text**, and **Color Bars** clips to
4 hours.
- Increased maximum value of the **Timer** filter's **Start Delay**,
**Duration**, and **Offset** parameters to 24 hours.
- Improved Export Job progress and estimated time remaining.

## New Features

### Blur Filters

In the previous versions of Shotcut the Blur video filter could create dark
edges on the image. Therefore, 3 new blur filters were added that do not
have this problem:

- **Blur: Exponential** (fast)
- **Blur: Low Pass** (fast)
- **Blur: Gaussian** (slow)

However, they do not support Keyframes or support blurring in only a horizontal
or vertical direction. So, the existing blur filter was retained but renamed
**Blur: Box**.

### Main Toolbar

The previous version changed the appearance of the toolbar to address a high
density (DPI) issue on Linux. However, that made the icons larger for most 
people. Also, some people would simply hide the main toolbar since it took up
so much space. Now, there are two new options in the **View** menu:

- **Show Text Under Icons** (default on)
- **Show Small Icons** (default off)

Additionally:

- Added **Jobs** to the main toolbar.

- Reordered panel buttons on main toolbar to match **View** menu.

### Alpha Channel Support for HTML-based Filters

Shotcut can use HTML technologies for video effects, but previously it was 
limited at support the existing image or video's alpha channel (transparency
mask) and would always overwrite it with its own alpha channel, which often
times was opaque. For example, this prevented maintaining transparency when
using 3D text on a transparent color clip. Now, it supports the alpha channel.
Using this, we have new Crop video filters.

### Crop Filters

Previous versions of Shotcut's Crop filter did not behave as some expected
because it removes pixels from the edges of the source and thus changes its
aspect ratio. Still, it can be useful when working with sources with a
higher resolution than the project because it does not require one to crop and
then upscale to remove black bars. Therefore, the existing crop filter was
renamed to **Crop: Source**, and two new crop filters were added using HTML.

- **Crop: Circle**
- **Crop: Rectangle**

These two new crop filters can use the HTML alpha channel support by changing
the alpha component of their Color parameter. This is very useful when using 
**Crop: Rectangle** or **Crop: Circle** while compositing video tracks.

### More New Things
