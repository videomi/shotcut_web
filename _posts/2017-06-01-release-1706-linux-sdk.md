title: New Release 17.06 with Linux SDK
author: Dan Dennedy
category: blog

Version 17.06 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/downloads/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}).

This version changes the maximum duration for a still image from 10 minutes to
four hours. As with previous versions, if you need an image to appear longer,
you can add the image more than once. In addition to some other bug fixes, this
version fixes a broken Chinese translation and adds a Hungarian translation.

For a while now, we have provided information about how to [setup a development
environment on Windows]({{ "/notes/windowsdev/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})
to hack Shotcut. As part of that, we created a Windows SDK that bundles together
most of Shotcut's dependencies as well as special build of Qt 5 that still
includes QtWebKit. These requirements still make development on Linux
troublesome for new or casual contributors. So, we have added a [Linux SDK
]({{ "/notes/linuxdev/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})
as well with setup instructions for Qt Creator.

Lastly, I want to remind readers of the [video instruction course by James Woo
](https://betterbusiness.newzenler.com/courses/video-editing-made-easy-with-shotcut-video-editor?affiliate=WrMMTH).
Yeah, there are quite a few YouTube videos now including our own, but they are
so-so. James' series is clear, concise, comprehensive, and a good value. There
are now over 40 tutorials for only $29!
