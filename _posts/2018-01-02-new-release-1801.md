Version 18.01 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

Here are the main fixes and enhancements in this new version:

* Added **Audio Spectrum Visualization** filter.
* Added support for font size and italics to the **Text** filter.
* Added a **Mask** filter.
* Another important fix for accuracy of XML time values, particularly for non-integer frame rates.

The following is a screenshot showing the new **Mask** filter with a diamond
shape. This filter only writes into the alpha channel of the video, which is the
transparency information. Therefore, it only shows results when compositing two
video tracks on the Timeline.
