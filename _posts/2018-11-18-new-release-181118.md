Version 18.11.18 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

- Fixed crash in Export (bug in v18.11.13).
- Fixed NVENC hardware encoders on Windows and Linux.
- Fixed VA-API hardware encoders on Linux. As a result, the Linux build is now
  based on Ubuntu 16.04 (glibc 2.23), which may reduce compatibility with older
  Linux systems.
- Fixed hardware encoder detection on Windows.
- Added **Audio Waveform Visualization** video filter.
- Added **MM:SS.SS** to **Timer** filter.
- Added IRE graticule and tooltips to the **Video Waveform** scope.
- Added support for the mouse wheel to the **Color Grading** circles.
- Added configuration setting player/warnGPU, which is a boolean that defaults true.
