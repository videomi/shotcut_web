## New Features

  - **Vertigo**
  
    <video width="640" height="360" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop">

    </video>

    &nbsp;
- Added **Keyframes** toolbar buttons and keyboard shortcuts for filter-trimming
and simple keyframes:
  * [ = set the filter start
  * ] = set the filter end
  * { = set the first simple keyframe
  * } = set the second simple keyframe
  * Alt+[ = seek previous simple keyframe
  * Alt+] = seek next simple keyframe
- Added keyboard shortcuts for **Filters**:
  * F = open the Filters panel and filter chooser. (At this point search has
focus and the first filter is selected...)
  * Up/Down - select the previous or next filter in the list
  * Enter = add the selected filter to the list
  * Shift+F = remove the selected filter from the list
- Added Thai translation.
