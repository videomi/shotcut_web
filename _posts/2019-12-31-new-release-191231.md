title: "New Version 19.12.31: Move Multiple"

Version 19.12.31 (aka 19.13) is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

Unfortunately, version 19.12.16 introduced a major new **bug when moving clips
on the Timeline with Ripple on**. This version not only fixes that but also
includes a highly requested feature that was a year end goal: **moving
multiple clips on the Timeline**! In addition, two more video scopes were
added: **RGB Parade** and **RGB Waveform**.

## Other Changes and Fixes

- Allow reducing track height to very short in **Timeline** and **Keyframes**.
- Fixed crackly audio playback for some Windows users.
- Fixed loading project files made before v19.06 when not using a period for a
  decimal point.
- Fixed **Lift** and **Ripple Delete** on **Timeline** not reliably removing all
  selected.
- Fixed checking **Properties > Image sequence** may not update duration in
  **Playlist**.
- Fixed the intra-VLC and non-linear-quantizer options in the XDCAM-422 and D10
  export presets.
