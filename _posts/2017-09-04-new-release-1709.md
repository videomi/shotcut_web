Version 17.09 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

While this version contains the usual round-up of fixes and translation updates,
it also contains some technology updates:

* Renewed the code signing certificate for the Windows installer and executable.
* Updated SDL to v2.0
* Updated FFmpeg to v3.2
* Updated x264, x265, and vp8/9 to the latest stable versions.

In addition, primarily for school/institution installations, we added the
ability to turn off the welcome message that suggests to check for an upgrade.
This works by either running the shotcut executable with the `--noupgrade`
command line option. Or, one can add the option "noupgrade" to the config file
or registry, under the General section with the value "true".
This option also hides the **Help &gt; Upgrade...** menu item.
