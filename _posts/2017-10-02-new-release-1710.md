title: New Release 17.10

Version 17.10 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/downloads/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

* Fixed multi-threaded decoding with FFmpeg v3.2.
* Added 1080p 59.94 and 60 fps video modes.
* Added support for NVENC to Export panel.

After upgrading FFmpeg to v3.2 in the [previous release]({{ "/blog/new-release-1709/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}),
we discovered a performance regression because multi-threaded
was not working. That is fixed now.

One thing that came with the FFmpeg upgrade is [NVENC](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-video-codec-sdk),
which is NVIDIA's hardware-based H.264 and HEVC encoding for
Linux and Windows. The quality is not as good as x264 and x265,
but it might be faster for previewing an export or capture or just to play
around with. To use it, you must have a NVIDIA GPU that supports it. You must
choose "h264_nvenc" or "hevc_enc" from the Export > Video > Codec drop-down
list - NOT the Format list. There are not presets provided. You can use the
Export defaults or one of the H.264 or HEVC presets and change the codec.
Just because it is listed does not mean it will work. The codec is listed
without doing any capability test. If you right-click the Export job and choose
*View Log*, then it may show some errors if it is not working. HEVC does not
support B frames on most (all?) current devices and drivers. This version
of Shotcut makes the Export > Codec rate control fields supply the correct
options for NVENC.
