Well, what do you know? It turns out there is a v15.08 for <a href="http://www.shotcut.org/bin/view/Shotcut/Download">download</a> after all! It was delayed due to build infrastructure problems and travel. While we have been focusing lately on a major UI toolkit upgrade, I wanted to get some fixes out. In addition, there are some new things:
<ul><li>Added a Greek translation (thank you, firewalker).</li><li>Added a <b>Ripple All Tracks</b> option to the Timeline menu (default is off).<br />In version 15.06, we changed insert and delete operations to ripple (move following clips) across <b>all</b> unlocked tracks. It turns out that enough new and casual users found that disorienting and did not realize there is track locking to control it. Therefore, we added a toggle option in the timeline menu (see button on timeline toolbar). More advanced users who want this behavior will have to turn it on.</li><li>5 new audio dynamics filters (thank you, Lauren):</li><ul><li>Compressor</li><li>Delay</li><li>Expander</li><li>Limiter</li><li>Reverb</li></ul>
