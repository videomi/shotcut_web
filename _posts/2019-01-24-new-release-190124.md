Version 19.01 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/downloads/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

Much of this release was based on contributions in the form of code, presets,
title templates, feedback, bug reports, and testing nightly builds or the beta.
Also, recently, we added a
[Contribute]({{ "/howtos/contribute/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})
page to the Web site.

## New Features

- Added **Center Playhead** option to the **Timeline** and **Keyframes** menus.
