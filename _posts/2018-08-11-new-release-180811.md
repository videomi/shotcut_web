Version 18.08.11 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

There have been enough major bugs found and fixed since the v18.08.01 release
at the beginning of the month to warrant making a new release:

* Fixed new crash in v18.08 changing **Settings > Video Mode** with nothing opened.
* Fixed crash while adjusting position or size in **Text** and **Size and Position** filters.
* Fixed position and size information incorrect if resolution or aspect ratio changed in **Export**.
* Fixed **Text** animation (keyframes) when not the first clip in the timeline.
* Fixed track name not editable after the track head had been selected at least once.
* Fixed right-clicking a timeline clip breaks automatic timeline scrolling during playback.
* Added Quicktime Animation **Export** preset to export video with alpha channel.
* In **Export**, let option values in **Other** tab override values generated by other fields.
