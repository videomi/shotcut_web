title: "New Version 18.11: And Hardware Encoding For All"
author: Dan Dennedy
category: blog
---

Version 18.11 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

This version brings hardware encoding to macOS and VA-API encoding for Linux.
Meanwhile, the experimental GPU Effects mode, which was always unstable and
unsupported is made a truly advanced option by hiding it. Now, one can only
enable it by manually changing the configuration file/registry. To make things
easier a **New Project** screen was added, most **Export** options are hidden behind an
**Advanced** button, hardware encoding gets a checkbox, and a signed macOS build is
provided.

Additional information about the new features is [available here]({{ "/blog/new-release-181113/#new-project-screen" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}).

### New Project Screen

This is entirely optional, but it will guide new and casual users to follow a
good practice: Set a Video Mode and make a folder for your project in which to
place companion files. When a project folder is used in Shotcut, the Overlay
HTML and Stabilize video filters automatically name and save their files in your
project folder instead of presenting a file save dialog. In the future, this
area will expand to offer options to copy or move your media files into the
project folder and eventually generate optimized and proxy media for editing.
If all files for a project are in the same folder or sub-folders of the .mlt
project file links in the project file use relative paths, and you can
move the project folder without breaking links.

### Hardware Encoding

If you do not manually configure this and click the checkbox to turn it on,
Shotcut probes your computer to determine what can be supported. The
**Configure...** button and dialog lets you see what was detected as well as
make manual overrides. If more than one hardware implementation is available on
your computer, this lets you control which one is used when using the checkbox.
If you clear all options in the configuration dialog and click the checkbox to
enable it, then it will re-run the automatic configuration. Shotcut only
supports H.264 and HEVC harware encoders using this easy interface. If you want
to use other codecs, you must use advanced configuration.

### Advanced Export Mode

Too many new and casual users currently get lost in or overwhelmed by
**Export**. So, nearly all options are hidden now to encourage usage of the
defaults or presets. When **Advanced** is enabled, a checkbox appears after the
button. Enable this checkbox to pin the **Export** to **Advanced** mode each
time you start Shotcut.

### Waveform Video Scope

This is a very basic scope with no options or graticule. It is just a start,
and more options and scopes will be added in the future.
