Shortly after the first release of 15.11 for Windows we discovered two new major problems that were fixed for a new 15.11.03 version, available now for <a href="https://github.com/mltframework/shotcut/releases/download/v15.11/shotcut-win64-151103.exe">download</a>. The problems were a failure to launch due to a missing DLL in the installer, and encode jobs stuck in a pending state and not completing.
