title: "New Version 20.04.12: Speed Pitch Compensation and Replace"
author: Dan Dennedy
category: blog
---

Version 20.04.12 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

The proxy management feature is not ready, but we worked on a building block
in the form a Replace edit command that is integrated into Reverse and
Convert to Edit-friendly. This will be used to asynchronously integrate proxies
after they have been generated.

## New

- Added **Properties > Speed > Pitch Compensation** for automatic pitch correction for speed changes > 0.1x.
- Added a **Replace** command to **Timeline** clip menu including blank regions with shortcut <kbd>R</kbd>.
- **Properties > Reverse** now automatically replaces a selected clip on the timeline (or in **Source** player if using that).
- Added 15 second handles when using **Properties > Reverse** on a timeline clip. Handles are extra footage before the in point or after the out point. This makes it easier to adjust edits or add transitions around reversed clips.
- Added **Properties > Duration > Timeline** to show (not editable) the duration of a timeline clip.
- Added a **Corner Pin** video filter (thanks to @sauron in the forum for the initial effort).

- Added a **Properties > Convert** button to make **Convert to Edit-friendly** in the menu more convenient (kept in the menu for now because a number of support tips reference it).
- **Properties > Convert** now automatically replaces respective clips in **Source** and **Timeline** and adds its clip to the **Playlist**.

## Fixes

- Fixed `=` in **Text: Simple** filter ignores all text before the sign (broken in v20.02).

  - **Choppy**
  - **Rutt-Etra-Izer**
  - **Swirl**
  - **Text: 3D**
  - **Text: HTML**
- Fixed Offset X and Y parameters of **Rotate and Scale** filter with **Preview Scaling**.
- Fixed video artifacts when using a video for a custom transition and **Export > Parallel processing**.
- Fixed video artifacts when using the **Distort** video filter and **Export > Parallel processing**.
- Fixed video artifacts when using the **Rotate and Scale** or **Size and Position** filters, multiple video tracks, and **Export > Parallel processing**.
- Fixed missing code-signing entitlements for macOS that caused crashes when using the following (broken in v20.02):
  - **Open Other > Audio/Video Device**
  - HTML-based video filters:
    - **Choppy**
    - **Crop: Circle**
    - **Crop: Rectangle**
    - **Rutt-Etra-Izer**

  - **Filters**
  - **Keyframes**
  - **Timeline**

- Fixed project not modified when changing transition properties.
- Fixed pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> in **Filters** search may open a playlist item.
- Fixed a regression in **JACK** transport control (broken in v19.12).
- Fixed a missing **Timeline** track **Lock** button animation when lock prevents something.
- Fixed clips can be moved to **locked** timeline tracks (broken in v19.12).
- Fixed treating paths with Windows drive letters as relative on macOS and Linux.
- Fixed automatically relinking filters with HTML files (when app location changes or moving projects).
- Fixed **Undo** followed by **Redo** after a **Lift** or **Remove** on a transition saves the transition as `INVALID`.
- Fixed some filters than use external files broken when using network (UNC) paths on Windows:
  - **LUT (3D)**
  - **Mask: From File**
  - **Text: HTML**
- Fixed **Filters > Copy** & **Paste** does not keep filter in and out points.
- Fixed opening with a file from the command line on Linux snap or portable.
- Fixed **Export** can overwrite a source when run from command line.
- Fixed **Keyframes** previous/next buttons not using the parameter track to which they belong but rather the current track.
- Fixed opening a playlist clip or a new clip breaks filters on **Timeline > Master** if it is selected.

## Changes

- Changed **Export > Video > Parallel processing** to default to *OFF* but also now it save the state between export jobs and app session.
- Added support for FFmpeg `sample_fmt` option to **Export > Other**.
- Automatically disable parallel processing on add-on bigsh0t (360) video filters.
- Stop adding `title="Anonymous Submission"` to MLT XML.
- Increased the priority of background jobs a little on macOS and Linux (still less than normal).
- Added `448k` to **Export > Audio > Bitrate**.
- Added automatically scroll the **Timeline** when you double-clock a clip to select-and-seek.
- Updated the mouse wheel behavior in **Keyframes** to match the changes to **Timeline** in version 20.02.
- Added an option to place an icon on the Desktop to the Windows installer.
- Add a cursor to the **Audio Waveform** scope.
- Removed **Export > Stream** as it is not supportable in its current state.
- Changed shortcuts <kbd>C</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to work with the clip under the playhead of the current track if no clip is selected. This makes it behave similar to other editing shortcuts.
- Changed the keyboard modifier for **skim** to <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>. This prevents <kbd>Shift</kbd> (previous modifier) when selecting multiple clips from changing playhead position. 
  NOTE: On macOS, in order to scroll Timeline or Keyframes horizontally with a mouse wheel (not Magic Mouse or track pad), you must also use *one* of the following:
  - <kbd>Control</kbd>
  - <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>
  - <kbd>Control</kbd>+<kbd>Command</kbd>
  - <kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>Command</kbd>
- Changed the **Matrix** parameter of the **Dither** video filter to be a drop-down combo box without keyframes support.
- Changed **Alpha operation > Write On Clear** to **Overwrite** on some video filters to make them more clear:
  - **Mask: Simple Shape**
  - **Chroma Key: Advanced**
