title: 'The Discussion Forum Is Now Free'

I decided to convert the discussion forum to be free-of-charge and supported 
through a moderate level of advertising. Some of you may know that I used to
request a donation to gain membership. If you made a donation in the past 30
days, then advertising is turned off for you for next month. There might be
an add-on package of services in the future that will include no ads in the
forum. Thank you to everyone who contributed financially this year.

IMPORTANT: As a result of this change, if you already have an account on the
forum you must reset your password.

Obviously, with the forum being free, the activity is going to increase, and I
may not always be very active in there. Some employers have said something like
"if only we could clone him&hellip;." ;-) Well, I am training my daughter who is
in college to help me. Initially, she will be providing technical support and
doing some web site maintenance. Eventually, I hope she can fix bugs and do
development. This endeavor is turning into a nice father-daughter, dynamic-duo
story!
