Version 16.02 is now available for <a href="{{  "/downloads/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">download</a>. This release is mostly just bug fixes and improvements to the integration of the clip speed option in Properties. There are a few new, minor things::

* Audio waveforms on timeline are updated incrementally as progress is made.
* Allow dual pass encoding for CBR.
* Added Show Video Thumbnails option to the timeline menu.
* Added Rebuild Audio Waveform to a timeline clip's context menu.
