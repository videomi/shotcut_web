In addition to little fixes here and there, <a href="{{  "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">this version</a> has a new filter menu to prevent the menus from getting too full as we add more.<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nFnfiARIX9c/VH_tFEY2gXI/AAAAAAAAGIQ/CrF4Lxn8n-s/s1600/new-filter-menu.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nFnfiARIX9c/VH_tFEY2gXI/AAAAAAAAGIQ/CrF4Lxn8n-s/s1600/new-filter-menu.png" height="320" width="212"></a></div><br>
Now, you can flag filters as favorites. The default list upon opening the menu is your favorites. Click the other icons to view all filters of that type. In addition, when GPU processing is enabled, you can use CPU-based video filters in addition to the GPU filters. We only show the CPU filters that are not redundant with their GPU counterpart. We only allow you to place CPU video filters after all GPU filters, but you can still reorder within those groups. This is done mainly for performance reasons - to prevent the video from having to go back and forth between CPU and GPU memory.
