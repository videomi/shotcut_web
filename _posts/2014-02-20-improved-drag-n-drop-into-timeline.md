Now, as of version 14.02.18, the clip rectangle aligns to the track, and there is snapping that can be toggled. Instead of an append-only operation, there are now overwrite (default) and insert (ripple) operations. Overwrite has been corrected to support overwriting multiple shots and gaps along with its corresponding undo action. Lastly, there is optional scrubbing in the program viewer while dragging.
