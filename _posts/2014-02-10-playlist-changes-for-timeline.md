As of version 14.02.08, we have changed some behavior of the Playlist and player that seemed necessary since the addition of the Timeline. It is still entirely possible to simply create a playlist project if you do not need multitrack. I myself often prefer to lay down my main story line using just a playlist. Then, maybe later I want to lay down a music bed. Therefore, we added "Add All to Timeline" to the playlist menu to "upgrade" a playlist project to a multitrack project. Now, the playlist also saves into the project MLT XML file along with the timeline. However, in a multitrack project, the playlist is like a media "bin" as seen in other programs - while still being optional. In addition, the player tabs now say "Source" and "Program" to reduce possible confusion having 2 Playlist tabs and 2 Timeline tabs on screen at the same time. Source shows a clip (or stream or device). In a playlist project, Program shows the playlist, and it shows the timeline in a multitrack project. Double-clicking a playlist item now always opens the shot in the Source player. This makes it more usable as a bin. In a playlist project, to seek to a playlist item, shift-double-click it or right-click it and choose Goto.
