Version 17.05 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}).

This version just fixes some bugs and updates translations. In particular, it
fixes a long standing bug that, on Windows, files with non-Latin characters in
the name or path can not be opened or saved.
