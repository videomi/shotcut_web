We noticed a couple of major new bugs in versions 15.04 and 15.05.02 (according to the download filename and Help > About). Therefore, we made some quick fixes, which you can <a href="{{  "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">download now (15.05.06)</a>:<br>
<ul><li>Fix frequent crashes with both Settings > GPU and Settings > Realtime turned off.</li><li>Fix the Timeline Split command producing incorrect results. If you saved a project with the faulty Split command in the short-lived v15.05.02, then the problems were also saved to the project, and there is no automatic fix for it. You should remove the problematic shots and recreate them.</li><li>On OS X, fix a crash when choosing Remove from the Timeline clip/blank context menu.</li><li>On OS X, fix the new <a href="{{  "/howtos/keyboard-shortcuts/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">keyboard shortcuts</a> for selection control (select under play-head, move selection, deselect).</li></ul>
