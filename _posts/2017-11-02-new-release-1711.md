**UPDATE:** Version 17.11 has been
[re-released (build 17.11.07)]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})
to fix a crash on MP3s with album art - a bug since v17.03.

Version 17.11 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

This new version of Shotcut has quite a few fixes plus the follow set of changes
and additions.

* Changed add-filter menu to be embedded instead of popup.
* Added **Master** label to **Timeline**.
* Show filters icon on track heads if track is filtered.
* Prioritize '0' shortcut for **Timeline** over **Playlist**.
* Do not adjust timeline zoom until slider is released.
* Added warning dialog to **Export** if file cannot be written (e.g. due to permissions).
* Added warning dialog to **Export** if chosen file is in the project.
* Added warning dialog to **Export** if the drive is low on space.
* Added Nepali translation.
* Added button to Text filter to insert the # symbol.

Shotcut lets you attach filters to many things - not only clips on the Timeline.
You can also attach filters to a track or even the entire timeline. In previous
blog and forum posts, I have referred to the top left corner block of the timeline
as "cornerstone" for lack of another reference. Also, I compared the ability to
filter the entire timeline (the result after compositing and mixing) as similar
to the "master out" volume slider on a sound mixing console.
Therefore, I added the label **Master** to this selectable block.
Furthermore, if you had added a filter to a track (by selecting the track head)
or to Master, then you could easily forget about it. Or it could have even occurred
by accident! Therefore, Shotcut now shows a **Filters** icon on a track head if
it has filters.

See the screenshot below. The Filters panel is showing the filters applied to
Master because it is selected, and there is a Filters icon on the Master track
head to indicate that it has filters.
