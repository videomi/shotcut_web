Version 21.03.21 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

The main purpose of the 21.03 release is to address new, major problems introduced in recent versions:

- Fixed `<tractor>` and `blank` considered missing and blocking export (broke in v21.01).
- Added an **Ignore** button to the missing files error dialog in **Export**.
- Fixed black frames appearing in **Slideshow Generator** (broke in v20.02).
- Fixed being able to use mouse wheel over **Timeline** and **Keyframes** zoom sliders (broke in v20.01).
- Improved sound quality with small changes in **Speed** with **Pitch Compensation** or **Pitch** audio filter
  (broke in v20.11).
- Fixed the **Timeline** clip audio waveform incorrect after adding transition by dragging the clip left.
- Fixed repairing a project file opened using a network path on Windows.
- Fixed writing a raw FLAC file does not set its duration.
- Fixed an elided file name in clip **Properties** can become the clip name.
