This release is packed with fixes and improvements in many areas!

###  New Features!

- Added support for [Intel Quick Sync Video](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/quick-sync-video/quick-sync-video-general.html) 
  hardware-accelerated video encoders to the Windows build (in **Export > Codec**
  choose h264_qsv or hevc_qsv).
- Added **Grid** and **Safe Area** overlays with a toggle/menu button to the player.
- Added snapping to the grid and safe areas for the VUI rectangle control as
  used by **Text**, **Size and Position**, and more filters.

- Added **Open Other** to the main toolbar with a drop-down menu.
- Added the ability to drag-n-drop folders from a file manager into Shotcut.
- Added the ability to supply multiple file and folder name arguments to the
  shotcut command line executable.
- Added the ability to make a temporary **Custom Video Mode** (leave **Name** blank).
- Added **Settings > Video Mode > Custom > Remove....**
- Added **View > Layout > Remove....**
- Added **Settings > Clear Recent on Exit** checkbox to prevent saving data on a
  shared computer account.
- Added command line option `--clear-recent` to enable **Clear Recent on Exit**
  and hide that option in the **Settings** menu.
- Added a dialog when you click to check for an update that asks if you want to
check for update automatically (at startup only) with the option to suppress the
dialog indefinitely.

### Fixes

- Fixed audio preview distortion on Windows (regression in v18.09).
- Fixed some AAC MP4 files start in the middle.
- Fixed un-mute a track may not draw its waveforms.
- Fixed whitespace in **Text** filter removed in **Export**.
- Fixed crash adding clip to **Timeline** after removing all tracks.
- Fixed simple keyframes go missing or not all the way to 00:00.
- Fixed switching from simple to advanced keyframes in **Text**, **Rotate and
  Scale**, **Timer**, and **Size and Position** filters.
- Fixed a possible crash when adding a transition by trimming.
- Fixed crash on macOS after the app restarts itself when some **Settings** are
  changed.
- Fixed moving a clip to the left where the right edge is not a blank.
- Fixed some **Timeline** actions do not work correctly after a **Ripple** move.
- Fixed undo/redo form trim-to-transition over a blank/gap.
- Fixed **Ripple** moving a clip to the end of a track was not extending the
  hidden black background.
- Hide the **Text** generator if **Settings > GPU Effects** is on (incompatible).
- Fixed the **Rotate and Scale** filter preset not saving keyframes for the
  **Scale** parameter.
- Fixed a crash opening multiple files at once either through **File > Open** or
  drag-n-drop from a file manager.
- Fixed a crash closing a playlist-only project with **Automatic Video Mode**.
- Fixed changing position or removing advanced keyframes for the **Scale**
  parameter of the **Rotate and Scale** filter distorting the aspect ratio of
  the image.
- Fixed **Timeline > Split** not working if the current track is empty. (It
  should split the topmost clip under the playhead.)
- Fixed clicking the reset button of the **Center** checkbox of the **Crop**
  filter does not re-enable the other controls.
- Fixed the **Timeline** and **Keyframes** timeline rulers are incorrect after
  changing **Settings > Video Mode**.
- Fixed a crash when the project frame rate is very low (< 6 fps).
- Fixed a crash when switching keyframes on and off for position and size
  parameters in video filter such as **Size and Position**, **Text**, and **Timer**.
- Fixed trimming multiple track filters hides them.
- Fixed making a **Text** preset does not save the text (only all other parameters).

### Changes and Improvements

- Changed resolution restriction from a multiple of 8 to a multiple of 2.
- Improved the layout of the filter chooser in **Filters**.
- Changed **Timeline** fade controls to behave the same as **Keyframes** simple
  keyframes.
- Changed the **Noise** generator from opening as a live source to a clip with a
  duration.
- Changed drag-n-drop to **Playlist** to not automatically open the first file
  unless the project is empty.
- Changed the **Rotation** parameter of the **Mask** filter to use degrees, and
  fixed its reset button.
- Added more library dependencies to the Linux portable tar, AppImage, and snap
  builds including the SWH LADSPA plugins.

### How to Check If You Have Quick Sync
  
You can simply try it in Shotcut by setting up your export as H.264, HEVC, or
MPEG-2 and then changing the video codec to h264_qsv, hevc_qsv, or mpeg2_qsv.
If the Export job fails, you can right-click the job in the Jobs panel and choose
Log.... Then, review the log for information about Quick Sync initialization.
Some older CPUs do not support HEVC. To determine if you should have it, or
whether HEVC should work:
- Press Win+R to get the Windows Run dialog.
- Type "dxdiag" and press Enter to run DirectX Diagnostic Tool.
- Within dxdiag, choose Save All Information... and save it as a text file somewhere.
- Open the text file you just saved in a tool such as Notepad and search for
  "quick sync". If you have it, you will see a line like "Intel<sup>&reg;</sup>
  Quick Sync Video H.264 Encoder MFT." If your Intel chipset supports HEVC, it
  will say something like "Intel<sup>&reg;</sup> Hardware H265 Encoder MFT."

Additional support for hardware-accelerated encoding on macOS and Linux is a
work-in-progress. Windows was simply easier as it did not require much work in
the engine (MLT). VAAPI on Linux requires integration of FFmpeg hwupload. On
macOS, VideoToolbox is not yet working without a hardware decoding context,
which is not yet integrated.
