title: "New Version 19.02: Qt Upgrade and HTTPS"
author: Dan Dennedy

Version 19.02 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/downloads/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

The main announcement for this release is a major update to an important library
that Shotcut uses for the UI (user interface) called [Qt](https://www.qt.io/).
There have 6 major releases and two LTS (long term support) releases since the
version we were using. The new version we are using is **Qt 5.9.7**, which is
LTS (5.9) and is quite stable given the number of revisions (.7). It is a little
faster as well. We did not upgrade to the latest LTS (5.12) in order to retain
compatibility with macOS 10.10 and 10.11, and we want to use the same Qt version
across platforms. (Linux Flatpak is an exception.) With our new Qt builds, we
added support for **HTTPS**, which extends to our HTML effects based on WebVfx
and QtWebKit. This will let custom HTML titles and effects that you make link
to JavaScript libraries on the Web, which is mostly HTTPS now.
