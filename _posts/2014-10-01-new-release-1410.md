Since it is the beginning of the month, it is time for a <a href="{{  "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">new release</a> (v14.01) of Shotcut. This is primarily a maintenance release to fix some bugs. However, this version does introduce a Polish translation. Also, for Leap Motion control, the roles of open and closed hand have been swapped - close hand to pause, open it for shuttle control. This makes it operate more like other Leap apps and makes it more reliable when moving your hand in and out of Leap's view. In addition, FFV1 encoding has been fixed and restored. Thank you to everyone who has shown your support.
