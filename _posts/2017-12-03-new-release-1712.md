Version 17.12 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/downloads/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

This new version of Shotcut includes improvements for performance, accuracy,
and usability:

* Added icon, progress bar, and time remaining/taken to **Jobs** panel.
* Increased maximum resolution to 8192x8192.
* Indicate if variable frame rate is detected in **Properties**.
* Added **Convert to Edit-friendly...** dialog when variable frame rate or non-seekable file opened.
* Added **Convert to Edit-friendly...** to **Properties** menu for video and audio files.
* Adding, removing, and adjusting **Fade In/Out** filters now updates fade controls on the **Timeline**.
* Major speed improvements for **Timeline** rendering, especially when changing zoom level.
* Stop showing waveforms on muted tracks.
* Fixed audio crackling on some systems.
* Fixed accuracy of reading and writing time values, particularly for non-integer frame rates.

Shotcut tries hard to let you edit with many audio and video formats directly
without a conversion or import process. However, like most video editors, there
are some things that it simply cannot handle such as variable frame rate.
Unfortunately many screen, game, and device capture tools create such files.
Also, in order to support editing, Shotcut must be able to seek to a frame. This
version now tries to detect if a file is variable frame rate or non-seekable and
present a dialog to **Convert to Edit-friendly** format. To keep the process
rather simple but still satisfy different users' needs, it offers 3 pre-defined
options. More than likely, all of them will create a file that is larger than
the original, which is normal. However, at least you get some choice.

In addition, Shotcut (via MLT &amp; FFmpeg) only does a basic seek test. When it
succeeds, it is still not guaranteed to be frame accurate&mdash;that depends on
many factors: format, codec, parameters of codec, the tool that wrote it,
FFmpeg's code, MLT's code, versions, etc. There is simply no good way to
reliably test for that at the moment. Also, even when seeking works, some files
and the way they were encoded seek slowly and may require **Settings >
Interpolation > Bilinear** or better to increase accuracy making it even slower.
Therefore, you can choose to convert any audio or video clip to one of the
edit-friendly (frame accurate and relatively fast-seeking) formats by using
**Properties > Menu > Convert to Edit-friendly....**
