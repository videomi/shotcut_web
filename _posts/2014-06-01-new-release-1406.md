Now we give you <a href="{{  "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">release 14.06</a>, which is mainly just a bug fix release with some changes under the hood to prepare for future needs. Here are some of the improvements:<br>
<ul><li>Fix opening files with names or paths that include extended characters on Windows.</li><li>Add logging of program execution info to a text file to help with troubleshooting. The logging is very limited at this time and mainly intended to help indicate app startup failures. The log is stored in the same <a href="{{  "/FAQ/#where-are-the-log-presets-database-and-settings-stored" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">location as the database and presets</a>.</li><li>Show error message if trying to load MLT XML project file that is incompatible with current GPU processing setting.</li><li>Upgrade x264 from something that was 1.5 years old to latest.</li><li>Upgrade FFmpeg from version 2.1 to 2.2.</li><li>Upgrade Movit (GPU processing) from pre-1.0 to 1.1.1.</li><li>Update translations.</li></ul>
