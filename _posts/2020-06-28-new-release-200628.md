- Added [bigsh0t](https://bitbucket.org/leo_sutic/bigsh0t) 360&deg; video filters (contributed by Leo Sutic):
  - **360: Equirectangular Mask**
  - **360: Equirectangular to Rectilinear**
  - **360: Hemispherical to Equirectangular**
  - **360: Rectilinear to Equirectangular**
  - **360: Stabilize**
  - **360: Transform**
- Added **Open Other > Blip Flash** generator.
- Added 2 new Export presets: **Slide Deck (H.264)** and **Slide Deck (HEVC)**.
- Added a **Background color** parameter to the **Rotate and Scale** and **Size and Position** video filters.
- Added **Help > Topics** with keyboard shortcut <kbd>F1</kbd>.
- Added the ability to drag-n-drop from external file manager (Explorer, Finder) directly to **Timeline**.
- Added **Merge with next clip** to the timeline clip context menu. This only works for clips that are from the same source and contiguous. This is not clip grouping.
- Added returning to the original file if you **Reverse** a reversed clip.
- Added **Settings > Synchronization...** to calibrate the Shotcut player. This works while something is currently playing to help you calibrate using a known good clip.
- Added millisecond **Format** options to the **Timer** video filter.
- Added **Add a keyframe** button to the **Keyframes** panel for all parameters (previously it was missing on some paramters).
- Added the **Reduce Noise: Wavelet** video filter.
- Added a context menu (right-click) to the **Recent** panel with a **Remove** action.
- Added keyboard shortcut <kbd>;</kbd> to toggle a keyframe at the playhead position.
- Added keyboard shortcut <kbd>F2</kbd> to rename a clip.
- Added keyboard shortcut <kbd>F3</kbd> to search in **Recent**.
- Added keyboard shortcut <kbd>F11</kbd> to toggle fullscreen.
- Added **View > Enter Full Screen** on Windows, but simply maximizes due to issues with popup (dialog) windows not appearing on top.
- Added progress dialogs in several places where time consuming activities occur that otherwise block the user interface.

## Changes

- Stop selecting **Output** (formerly Master) by default when opening a project.

- Added a **Detect** button to the **Use hardware encoder > Configure** dialog.
