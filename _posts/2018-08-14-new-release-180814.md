Version 18.08.14 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/downloads/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

Unfortunately, the [previous release
18.08.11]({{ "/blog/new-release-180811/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})
introduced a major regression that can corrupt project files if your project
has clips where you had changed Speed in Properties. If you have a project
file that no longer loads, you can fix it in a simple text editor:

1. Open the .mlt file in a text editor (notepad.exe not recommended)
2. Locate every line with `<property name="shotcut:comment">`.
3. If the text that follows it **on the same line** before `</property>` is
   incorrect or has strange characters, remove the text between the property
   tags. The line should now look like  
   `<property name="shotcut:comment"></property>`.
4. Save the file with a new name that ends with .mlt
5. Try to load the repaired XML file.
