Version 15.12 is now available for <a href="{{  "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">download</a>. 

This release mostly only contains bug fixes, but there are a couple of new things:

<ul><li>a Slovak translation (thank you Stano110)</li><li>the ability to restore a crashed session not yet saved as a project (Untitled)</li></ul>
