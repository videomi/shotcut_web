**UPDATE:** Version 18.06 has been
[re-released (build 18.06.02)]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})
to fix a new crash bug that was discovered.

Version 18.06 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

Not only did the previous version (18.05) introduce major features and changes
but also many new bugs. Let's just call that release a "technology preview." We
paid a lot of attention to the feedback and fixed most of the problems for this
version. But that's not all! Take a look at this:

* Added **Reverse** to clip **Properties** menu.
* Added **Detach Audio** to timeline clip's context menu.
* Added simple and advanced **Keyframes** to the **Blur**, **Mask**, and **Saturation** filters.
* Added seek buttons for simple **Keyframes**.
* Added ability to add and remove advanced **Keyframes** using double-click.
* Added ability to drag advanced **Keyframes** to adjust both value and position.  
  (When dragging, hold down Ctrl key to adjust only value or Alt key to adjust only position.)
* Added double-click to toggle simple **Keyframes** controls (circles).
* Added double-click to toggle fade in/out controls on **Timeline** clip.
* Added many animated (keyframes) presets to the **Size and Position** filter.
* Added **Hue/Lightness/Saturation** video filter.
* Added 5.1 surround support to the **Copy Channel** and **Swap Channels** audio filters.
* Added caution message to GPU Effects confirmation dialog.
* Added a **Keyboard Shortcuts** link to the **Help** menu.
* Changed presets file format to YAML.
* Changed **Settings > GPU Processing** to **GPU Effects**.
* Reduced memory usage on 32-bit builds (by constraining multi-threading).
* Upgraded [FFmpeg to v4.0](http://ffmpeg.org/index.html#news).
* Integrated [AMD AMF](https://gpuopen.com/gaming-product/advanced-media-framework/) hardware-accelerated H.264 and HEVC encoders on Windows (Set **Export > Codec** to **h264_amf** or **hevc_amf**. Requires recent Radeon or AMD APU.)
* Upgraded MLT to git master ([v6.8.0](https://www.mltframework.org/blog/v6.8.0_released/) minimum required to build).
