We recently discovered that versions 14.09 - 14.12 were failing to launch on systems running OS X 10.8 and older. In the course of fixing it, we believe the problem could affect more than just those versions of OS X - a Linux user reported a similar problem. Also, we noticed a regression on Windows with the ability to drag-n-drop files onto the player window after a filter using on-video controls (VUI) had been used at least once during the session. Therefore, a new 14.12.06 build of the <a href="{{  "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">14.12 release is available for download</a> to address these problems.
