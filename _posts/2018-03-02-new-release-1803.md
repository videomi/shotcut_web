**UPDATE**: version 18.03 has been reissued (18.03.06) to address a couple of

As a bonus, the **Mosaic** video filter has been added.

Here are the highlights of this release:

* Added a **Sketch** filter.
* Added numeric fields to the **Color Grading** filter.
* Added **All** option to **Properties > Audio > Track**.
* Added **Estonian** translation.
* Improved image loading speed on Windows.
* Improved mouse-wheel & trackpad scrolling in **Timeline**.
* Improved support for JACK Audio (Linux and macOS only).
* Upgraded FFmpeg to version 3.4 and latest vpx for much faster VP9 encoding.
* Upgrade MLT to v6.6.0.
* Upgraded SDL to version 2.0.
