Previously, the X, C, V, and B keys could be used to edit the multitrack timeline or the playlist when the timeline is not being used (no tracks). This could be confusing, not to mention making it unable to use shortcuts to affect the playlist/bin in a timeline project. As of version 14.04.04, we now <b>require the Shift key</b> to be held when using X, C, V, and B to target the playlist; otherwise these shortcuts target the timeline.
