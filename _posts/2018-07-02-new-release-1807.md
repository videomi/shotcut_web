#### About the Change to Reverse

When this feature was added in the previous version 18.06, it would reverse an
entire file. If you just wanted to reverse a trimmed shot, then you had to
manually export it as something and then open and reverse the result of that.
Moreover, many formats do not work well to seek each frame backwards and would
give poor results. This new version takes care of both of those by adding two
jobs: convert and reverse. The convert step also performs trimming using the in
and out points from either the clip in the Source player or a clip selected on
the Timeline. The reverse job automatically deletes the intermediate result
of the convert job.

#### About Copy Timeline to Source

Often you want to export a portion of the timeline - whether to preview it,
troubleshoot an export problem, or to so-called "bake" effects. This could be
done previously by saving the project, using **File > Open MLT XML as Clip...**,
trimming this virtual clip in the **Source** player, and then export the
trimmed virtual clip. This new menu item in the **Timeline** menu simply makes
that more convenient and also works with an unsaved project. It simply opens a
**copy** of the current timeline project in the **Source** player where you can
trim and then export (make sure to check **Export > From**).

#### About the New HTML Template for WebVfx JavaScript Extensions

Previously, if you added the **Overlay HTML** video filter, enabled the **Use
WebVfx JavaScript Extensions** checkbox, and clicked **New...** you would get a
starting HTML document that did NOT use WebVfx and could be broken if you did
not add the WebVfx code (or add it correctly). Now, you at least get a page with
some basic WebVfx JavaScript. But also, this page includes a [Web Animations
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API/Using_the_Web_Animations_API)
polyfill to seek on HTML5 animations, and it uses Web Animations to scroll the
entire document from off the bottom edge to off the top edge over the duration
of the clip (i.e. scrolling credits). **View Source** in the WYSIWYG HTML editor
is your gateway to modify the animation for your needs.
