Fade in and out filters have been added as of version 14.03.01. There are 2 video filters - Fade From Black and Fade To Black - plus 2 new audio filters: Fade In and Fade Out. The video filters support GPU processing if you can use that.<br>

As you can see in the screenshot, fade conrols are available on the shots directly on the timeline making it very easy and convenient to add the filters and adjust audio+video in a tandem/ganged fashion. Simply move the mouse pointer to the top-left corner or top-right corner of a particular shot to make a pulsating circle appear. Then, click and drag the circle control horizontally to drag-out a fade rectangle. But that does not mean you have to use the timeline to utilize these new filters. If you are simply working with a clip or playlist project, you can still apply and use these filters.

And before you ask, no, this update does not include or support cross-fading audio or cross-dissolving video. That is coming next.
