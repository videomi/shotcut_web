title: "New Version 18.12: New and Improved Mask Filters"
author: Dan Dennedy

Version 18.12 is now available for [**DOWNLOAD**]({{ "/download/" | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }})!

The new **Mask: Apply** filter makes it possible to mask filters without using
multiple tracks! Use **Mask: Simple Shape** or **Mask: From File** to start the
filter mask followed the video filters to be masked followed by **Mask: Apply**
to apply the mask to the filters in between. Filters before or after the mask
filters affect the entire video frame. One can still use **Mask: Simple Shape**
or the new **Mask: From File** to affect the alpha channel for multitrack
compositing as before.

## New Features

* Added **View > Scopes > Video Histogram**.
* Added **Preset** to some more filters:
  - **Audio Gain/Volume**
  - **Blur**
  - **Brightness**
  - **Opacity**
* Added **Preset** and simple and advanced keyframes to the **Balance** and **Pan** audio filters.
* Added a **Levels** video filter with simple and advanced keyframes!
* Added **Properties > Color Range** for video clips.
* Replace the **Mask** video filter with 3 new filters:
  - **Mask: Simple Shape**
  - **Mask: From File**
  - **Mask: Apply**

The new **Mask: From File** is a powerful new video filter offering 3 modes:
1. wipe transition (stock or custom)
1. **Channel > Brightness** from a video or image file (**File > Custom...**)
1. **Channel > Alpha** from a video or image file

Moreover, **Threshold** can be animated with simple or keyframes, which is
especially nice when used with luma-wipe image files (stock or custom). Not only
can you wipe on a filter but also you can use this as an alternative way to make
a wipe transition using multiple tracks (instead of same track transition).

## Fixes

* Fixed color accuracy of **lossless/Ut Video** preset and use yuv422p format.
* Fixed number of digits for seconds in the **Timer** video filter when using **Format > MM:SS.SS**.
* Fixed compositing completely transparent areas of alpha channel darkens output.

* Fixed **Settings > External Monitor > DeckLink/Intensity** can stall when **Settings > Realtime** is enabled.
* Fixed making project folder if a parent folder does not exist.
* Fixed **New Project > Start** does not save a .mlt file until you open media and save.
* Fixed launch on some Linux (e.g. gentoo) by including libselinux .
* Fixed crash when undo **Playlist > Remove All**.
* Fixed auto-saved file not removed when save and exit with no changes.
* Fixed the color accuracy of the **Color** generator.
* Fixed numeric locale bug in the **Audio Spectrum Visualization** and **Audio Waveform Visualization** filters.
* Fixed clip reloaded when leaving **Properties > Speed** with no change.
* Fixed **Settings > External Monitor** on Windows screen.
* Fixed launch crash on Linux with (Csound) csladspa < 6.11.1 installed.
