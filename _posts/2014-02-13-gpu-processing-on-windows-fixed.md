As of v14.02.12, GPU processing works again in Windows! Of course, you need a video card and driver that supports at least OpenGL version 3.2. This has only been tested on systems with NVIDIA, but it should work with other providers.

Also, as v14.02.13, drag-n-drop of shots from either the Playlist or the Source player into the timeline is working now on Windows and OS X. (Previously, it only worked on Linux.) This is very basic at the moment by only letting you append a shot to a track, but it was necessary to get it working across platforms before enhancing it.
